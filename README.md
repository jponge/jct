# A friendly fork of JCTools

This is a friendly fork of [JCTools](https://github.com/JCTools/JCTools) for releasing purposes.

As of November 2023 no maintainer of JCTools is available to make releases.
This fork exists to publish releases since we needed the current state of the `master` branch for some ongoing work in [SmallRye Mutiny](https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-mutiny) and possibly other projects.
